# architecture-v1
Dedicated to people who want to learn microservices based on my personal notes and experiences.

## Introduction

Microservices has become a buzzword in today's industry. Everybody would like to follow this architecture and apply it in their business with enough confidence to consider that it fits them without understanding the full requirements and drawbacks they generate. 

My mission is to clear mist that have been generated over the internet by those individuals which write a lot of tutorials, and pages which I found most of them to be very confusing and incomplete. 

This series is dedicated to you, well especially most developers who want to start learning about microservices or maybe to improve their knowledge. You will find here a list of projects, each one containing a separate application which will be in deep dissussed and explained with a lot of concepts, patterns, techniques that are widely used in a microservice architecture. 

In this first project tho, we will start exploring the most important concepts and patterns that you will have to learn in order to begin your journey in building microservices by creating an **e-commerce** application.
